# Day 03 - Exercises on Python strings and lists


## These exercises are designed to be finished in class.
## Once you are happy with your code, push it to Github
## and your submission will be auto-graded. If your 
## submission does get the full grade, you have the option
## of resubmitting it (unlimited attempts till the end of
## the day). 
##
## Note that you need to get outputs exactly as specified
## as the autograder looks for an exact match. 
##
## You have as many attempts to do this as you would like,
## and you can ask for help from us, or from your friends.
## You do not need to acknowledge help received for this
## particular activity; however, please make sure that you
## understand the code that you end up writing.


# 
# A string called "text" is defined in the code below. Your task is to loop through the string, 
# and produce an output where each word is printed separately in a new line, with a '-' 
# (without the quotes) printed after each line. The '-' character should be in its own line.
# So, your output is going to look like this:
# 
# Pythons
# -
# are
# -
# some
# -
# of
# -
# the
# -
# largest
# -
# snakes
# -
# in
# -
# the
# -
# world
# -

text = "Pythons are some of the largest snakes in the world"

## Write your code here. Remember, there may be more than one correct way of writing your code
    myList = text.split(" ")
    print(myList)


# Once you are done with the task above, print each element of the list below, with each element turned
# into upper-case (capitalized).
# Hint: You can use the .upper() string method to achieve this.
# Your output should look like the following:
# 
# PYTHONS
# ARE
# NONVENOMOUS

wordlist = ["Pythons", "are", "nonvenomous"]

## Write your code here
